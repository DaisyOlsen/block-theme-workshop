### LocalWP Instructions:

3. Open admin for the new site
4. Navigate to the workshop-blocks theme directory for the site using your preferred file manager or IDE

### Fresh WordPress Install Instructions:
If you prefer not to use LocalWP for creating a local WordPress environment please create a WordPress 5.7.x environment of your choice.

1. Install and Activate the Gutenberg Plugin from the plugin directory.
2. Install and Activate the workshop-blocks theme found in this repository.
3. Navigate to the workshop-blocks theme directory for the site using your preferred file manager or IDE

_Note:_ This repo may be updated with incremental branches as the workshop progresses to allow attendees to "catch up" with the progress of hands-on elements or for future review.


I have the app on a Flash Drive in case anyone has trouble getting it downloaded.
